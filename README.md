## pre requires

- VS CODE (We'll be using vs code running on an instance)
- Git installed on EC2

## Steps

### 1) Create a New Repo

- In GitHub create a new repo, this is where Git will push the cloned repo.
- Save the link as you will need it for later

### 2) Clone repo

- In VS code create a new directory. This is where we will put the cloned repository 
   -`mkdir repo_name`
- Once create cd into it and then cd into .git and clone
   - `cd .git`
   - `git clone repo_url`

### 3) Set config files

- while in the git directory 
   -`nano config`
- This is where git links to GitHub
- `[remote "origin"] url = repo_link`
- save and exit

### 4) Push clone to GitHub

- Before you can push the changes to the remote repository username and email must be created
-  `git --global user.name "your_name"`
-  `git --global user.email "your_email"`
-  Once credentials have been set up run the push command
   `git push`
- If this is the first time push you will be required to authorize git to GitHub
- Copy and paste the authorization code generated by git and paste it into GitHub
- check the GitHub repo for confirmation
