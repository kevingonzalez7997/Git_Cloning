## pre requires

- VS CODE (Optional but VS offers a better user experience)(We'll be using vs code running on an instance)
- Git installed on EC2

## Steps

### 1) Create a New Repo

- In GitHub create a new repo, this is where Git will push the cloned repo. ( This will be considered the remote location) 
- Save the link as you will need it for later

### 2) Clone repo

- In VS code create a new directory (This will be considered the local location). This is where we will put the cloned repository 
   -`mkdir repo_name`

- Clone the repository from where the repo with source code is located  
  -`git clone repo_link`


### 3) Set config files 
- cd into the freshly cloned repo and then cd into the main branch
- while in the main branch directory
  -`cd .git` 
   -`nano config`
- This is where git links to GitHub
- `[remote "origin"] url = repo_link`
- link and put the remote location URL, save, and exit 
- cd back into the repo directory on the local

### 4) Branch and merge
It is good practice to branch repo, creating a staging environment before deployment
- `git branch new_branch_name`
- `git merge branch_name`
-After making changes, stage them using the git add command, and then commit your changes
   -`git add .`
   -`git commit -m "Your commit message here"`
  
### 4) Push clone to GitHub (pushing local to remote)

- Before you can push the changes to the remote repository, a username and email must be created
-  `git --global user.name "your_name"`
-  `git --global user.email "your_email"`
-  Once credentials have been set up run the push command
   `git push`
- If this is the first time push you will be required to authorize git to GitHub
- Copy and paste the authorization code generated by git and paste it into GitHub
- check the GitHub repo for confirmation
